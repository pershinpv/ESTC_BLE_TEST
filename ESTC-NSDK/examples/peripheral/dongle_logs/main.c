 * @brief Example logging over USB (for nrf52840 dongle or DK).
 *
 * This example contains all the necessary code to build logging over the USB.
 *
 * Example inverts LED colours every second and prints a message to the USB log.
 *
 * It is possible to configure USB stack manually by setting
 * LOG_BACKEND_USB_INIT_STACK to 0 or leave USB init to the stack by setting
 * LOG_BACKEND_USB_INIT_STACK to 1.
